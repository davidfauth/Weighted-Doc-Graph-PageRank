# Welcome to Mortar!

Mortar is a platform-as-a-service for Hadoop.  With Mortar, you can run jobs on Hadoop using Apache Pig and Python without any special training.  You create your project using the Mortar Development Framework, deploy code using the Git revision control system, and Mortar does the rest.

# Getting Started

This Mortar project is a generic framework for calculating Pageranks for the nodes of any directed graph. There are two example scripts which demonstrate its use. `patents-pagerank` runs Pagerank on a graph of patent citation relationships to find which organizations produce the most influential patents. `twitter-pagerank` runs Pagerank on a graph of Twitter follower relationships to find the most influential Twitter users. Alternatively, you can configure the template script `my-pagerank` to run Pagerank on your own data (see the last section of this README). Regardless of which you choose, there are some steps to get started:

1. [Signup for a Mortar account](https://app.mortardata.com/signup)
1. [Install the Mortar Development Framework](http://help.mortardata.com/#!/install_mortar_development_framework)
1. Clone this repository to your computer and register it as a project with Mortar:

       	git clone git@github.com:davidfauth/Weighted-Doc-Graph-PageRank.git
        cd Weighted-Doc-Graph-PageRank
        mortar register Weighted-Doc-Graph-PageRank
	
1. Configure the data sources. 
		In controlscripts/docGraphPageRank.py file, modify the location of the edges variable to point to the location of your DocGraph dataset.
		In controlscripts/pagerank_lib.py file, modify the location of the NUCC_CODES_INPUT and NPI_DATA_INPUT file locations.

## DocGraph Example

Once everything is set up, you can run the Patents example with the command:

        mortar run docGraphPageRank --clustersize 5 --singlejobcluster

		By default this script will run on the full DocGraph data set with the most followers and finish in about 1 hour and 30 minutes using a 5 node cluster.

# DocGraph Data

		The data we're using comes from [About DocGraph](http://notonlydev.com/docgraph/) headed up by [Fred Trotter](http://twitter.com/fredtrotter)

# The Pagerank Algorithm

Pagerank simulates a random walk over a weighted directed graph, where the probability of going from a node N to a node M over an edge is that edge's weight divided by the sum of the outgoing edge weights for node N (unweighted graphs simply set each edge weight to 1.0). The pagerank of a node is the probability that after a large number of steps (starting at a random node) the walk will end up at that node. There is also a chance at each step that the walk will "teleport" to a completely random node: this added factor allows the algorithm to function even if there are "attractors" (nodes with no outgoing edges) which would otherwise trap the walk.

Pagerank is an iterative algorithm.  Each pass through the algorithm relies on the previous pass' output pageranks (or in the case of the first pass a set of default pageranks generated for each node). The algorithm is considered done when a new pass through the data produces results that are "close enough" to the previous pass. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagerank for a more detailed algorithm explanation.

# What's inside

## Control Scripts

The files `./controlscripts/twitter-pagerank.py` and `./controlscripts/patents-pagerank.py` are the top level scripts that we run in Mortar to find Pageranks, for the Twitter graph and the Patent Citations graph respectively. All they do is set parameters for shared code in `controlscripts/pagerank_lib.py` and call it. This shared code uses [Embedded Pig](http://help.mortardata.com/reference/pig/embedded_pig) to run our various pig scripts in the correct order and with the correct parameters.

The file `./controlscripts/my-pagerank.py` is the template which you can configure to run Pagerank on your own data.

For easier debugging of control scripts all print statements are included in the pig logs shown on the job details page in the Mortar web application.

## Pig Scripts

This project contains six pig scripts: three for generating graphs to use with Pagerank and three which implement the Pagerank algorithm.

### generate\_twitter\_graph.pig

This pig script takes the full Twitter follower graph from 2010 and returns the subset of the graph that includes edges between the top 100 000 users by \# followers.

### generate\_patent\_citation\_graph.pig

This pig script takes the US Patent Grant dataset (already in PigStorage form), projects from all the available information just the citation graph, and does the reduction so that each node is an organization instead of an individual patent, as described earlier.

### generate\_my\_graph.pig

This template script shows steps you might take to generate a graph from your own data to input into the Pagerank scripts.

### pagerank\_preprocess.pig

This pig script takes an input graph and converts it into the format that we'll use for running the iterative pagerank algorithm. This script is also responsible for setting the starting pagerank values for each node.

### pagerank\_iterate.pig

This pig script calculates updated pagerank values for each node in the graph.  It takes as input the previous pagerank values calculated for each node.  This script also calculates a 'max\_diff' value that is the largest change in pagerank for any node in the graph.  This value is used by the control script to determine if its worth running another iteration to calculate even more accurate pagerank values.

### pagerank\_postprocess.pig

This pig script takes the last iteration output of nodes, projects out just the node-ids and their pageranks, orders them by pagerank, out stores the final output to S3.

# Pagerank Parameters

## Damping Factor

The damping factor (in academic papers, usually the greek letter alpha) determines the variance of the final output pageranks.  This is a number between 0 and 1 where (1 - DAMPING\_FACTOR) is the probability of the random walk teleporting to a random node in the graph. At 0 every node would have the same pagerank (since edges would never be followed).  Setting it to 1 would mean the walks get trapped by attractor nodes and would rarely visit nodes with no incoming edges.

A common value for the damping factor is 0.85. Lowering the damping factor will exponentially speed up convergence, but at the cost of your pageranks not reflecting as much of the true underlying structure of the graph.

## Convergence Threshold

The intermediate pageranks calculated by each iteration in the algorithm will converge to fixed values for each node after an infinite number of iterations. As for many use cases this is too long to wait, we stop the iterations when the latest iteration's results are "close enough" to the last iteration's results as determined by some convergence metric.

We make our convergence metric the sum of all of the "ordering-rank" changes of the pageranks. "ordering-rank" in this case means the pagerank's position in the ordering of all pageranks from greatest to least--so the highest pagerank has ordering-rank 1, and the least has ordering-rank N. A swap of ranks 2 and 5 would be two ordering-rank changes of magnitude |2-5| = 3, so it would add 2*3 = 6 to the sum.

We converge when this sum of the ordering-rank changes from one iteration to the next is less than a parameter CONVERGENCE\_THRESHOLD * (# nodes)^2. The squared term is because the maximum possible number of ordering-rank changes for N nodes is proportional to N^2. The constant term is arbitrarily chosen, so you should decide how much accuracy is needed for your data.

## Maximum Number of Iterations

In case a graph takes too long to converge, the pagerank script will always halt after a number of iterations equal to the parameter MAX\_NUM\_ITERATIONS.

# Using your own data

## Generate a graph

To run Pagerank on your own data, you must first generate a directed graph from your data. The pigscript `my_preprocessing_script.pig` has some code snippets to help you get started. Your output should have a schema:

    from, to, weight

`from` and `to` are the ids of the nodes the edge comes from and goes to respectively. They can be of type int, long, chararray, or bytearray. `weight` is a measure of the magnitude or significance of an edge. It can be of type int, long, float, or double. The fields should be tab-delimited (this is the default for PigStorage).

If your graph is undirected, you must make two records for every connection, one from A to B and another from B to A. If your graph is unweighted, simply make every weight 1.0.

## Configure the controlscript

Next, edit the controlscript `my-pagerank.py` to use your data. Each parameter that needs to be set is listed and explained in the template.

If your data is small (< 250 MB or so), you can follow the instructions in the file to configure it to run in Mortar's "local mode". Local mode installs Pig and Jython so you can run your script on your local machine. This allows you to run your Mortar project for free and avoids the overhead time of Hadoop scheduling jobs on a cluster.

## Run your controlscript

Once you have your controlscript configured, you can have a cluster calculate Pageranks for your data using the command:

    mortar run my-pagerank --clustersize N

where N is an appropriate number for the size of your data (try 3 for each GB of data you have).

Alternatively, if you configured your controlscript to use local mode, you can run the script on your local machine using the command:

   mortar local:run my-pagerank
